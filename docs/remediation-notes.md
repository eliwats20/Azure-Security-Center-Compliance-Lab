## üîç Additional Notes

- **Guest Configuration** was installed via the Azure Portal using the ‚ÄúAzure Machine Configuration extension for Windows‚Äù published by Microsoft Corporation.
- **Diagnostic settings** were configured to send logs to a Blob Storage account (`eliyahsa`) with a 5 GB quota, using Error-level logging only to minimize storage usage.
- **NSG rules** were manually reviewed and updated to restrict inbound access to a specific public IP, eliminating exposure to the internet.
- **RDP access via public IP failed**, but connectivity through the VNet was successful. This was likely due to either:
  - NSG rules blocking public traffic
  - VM missing a public IP assignment
  - OS-level firewall settings
- **Defender for Servers**, **Defender CSPM**, and **Defender for Storage** were intentionally left disabled to avoid triggering paid services.
- **Secure Score** was observed at 0% due to pending evaluations. No critical or high-risk recommendations were present at the time of initial scan.
- **Compliance benchmark** (MCSB) was active and showed 57 out of 61 controls passed, indicating strong baseline posture.

## üìå Free-Tier Strategy

All remediation steps were performed using services and configurations eligible under Azure‚Äôs 12-month free-tier plan. This lab demonstrates how to achieve meaningful security posture improvements without incurring additional costs.
